    <p><strong>My dearest Janii,</strong></p>

    <p>
      Each day we get closer to your big day — and each day, my pride in you grows even more. You're not just preparing for an exam; you're walking toward a future you’ve dreamed of, and InshaAllah, that future is waiting with open arms. I know it's tough, I know sometimes you feel tired — but Wallah, you are doing so beautifully. Allah sees every effort, every moment of focus, every tear you hide, every silent prayer you make.
    </p>

    <p>
      I pray Allah puts barakah in your time, strength in your heart, and calm in your soul. May He make every answer clear to you, may your mind be sharp and focused, and may your results shine with success. Ameen.
      And may Allah continue to protect the love between us — through every phase, through every challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Janaa, whatever happens, I want you to know that you are already a winner to me. You carry so much strength, so much noor, and so much beauty — and I feel like the luckiest guy that Allah wrote me in your story. I’m walking this week with you in my heart and my duas, every moment.
      Soon, inshaAllah, we will be celebrating together — because your hard work will not go unanswered by the One who sees it all.
    </p>
