    <p><strong>My dearest Janii,</strong></p>

    <p>
     You are not just the love of my life — you are the softest corner of my heart, the calm in my chaos, the reason behind my every smile. Every time I look at you, I see strength wrapped in gentleness, dreams dressed in patience, and a soul so pure that I often wonder what good I did to deserve someone like you. Fizz, I don’t just love you — I cherish you. You’re the kind of person who makes life feel like a blessing just by being in it. When you’re happy, I feel like the world is perfect, and when you’re down, I wish I could carry your pain just to see you smile again. I pray for you in every sajda, in every silent wish, because nothing matters more to me than seeing you successful, peaceful, and deeply loved — always. With you, I’ve found not just a partner, but a home, a dream, a forever. May Allah keep our love growing stronger, protect us from all evil, and write a future for us where our hearts remain side by side — no matter what this world brings. I love you endlessly, Fizz.
    </p>

    <p>
     There’s something so magical about you — the way your smile heals everything inside me, the way your voice brings calm to even my stormiest days, the way your presence alone makes this world feel like home. Fizz, loving you isn’t something I do — it’s something I breathe. You're not just someone I want to spend my days with — you're the one I want to wake up beside for the rest of my life, through every sunrise, every prayer, every little moment that life gives us. You’ve taught me the meaning of softness, strength, faith, and forever. And Wallah, every time you’re near me or even cross my mind, I feel like I’m the luckiest person alive. You are my greatest blessing, and I’ll spend the rest of my life proving to you that my love is yours — in every season, in every test, in every heartbeat. InshaAllah, our love will grow with barakah, and Allah will unite our hearts forever in peace, happiness, and endless togetherness. Ameen
